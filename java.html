        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>
            Java is a powerful, versatile, and widely-used programming language designed to build robust, 
            secure, and platform-independent applications. Known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" 
            capability, Java enables developers to create programs that can run seamlessly across different systems.
            Its object-oriented design fosters code reusability and modularity, making it a preferred choice for developing 
            everything from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.

                <h2>ArrayDeque</h2>
                <p>This video explains the ArrayDeque class in Java, a double-ended queue offering efficient insertion and removal of elements from both ends. It outperforms other collections like LinkedList and ArrayList for queue operations. Key properties like dynamic resizing are covered, along with methods such as add(), remove(), peek(), and poll(). The video discusses its advantages, including improved performance for frequent queue operations, and its limitations.</p>

                <p>we explore the TreeSet class in Java, focusing on its implementation of the Set interface using a red-black tree. We discuss how TreeSet ensures uniqueness and automatic sorting of elements, along with efficient operations like adding, removing, and searching. The video also highlights advantages such as fast retrieval and sorting, as well as limitations like the lack of null elements. Common methods like add(), remove(), and contains() are demonstrated through examples.</p>

                <p>
                    This video covers the HashSet class in Java, part of the Java Collections Framework. It ensures uniqueness by disallowing duplicates and is backed by a hash table for efficient operations like add(), remove(), and contains() with constant time complexity. However, it does not maintain order. The video discusses its advantages, such as fast lookups, and disadvantages, like the lack of order and possible performance issues during iterations. Additionally, HashSet allows one null element.</p>

                <p>
                    This video covers the HashMap class in Java, explaining how it stores key-value pairs with unique keys using a hash table. It provides efficient operations like put(), get(), and remove(). While HashMap allows null keys and values, it does not guarantee element order. The video highlights its advantages, such as fast lookups, and its limitations, including potential hash collision issues.</p>

                <h2>Generics</h2>
                <p>we explore Generics in Java, a powerful feature that allows for type safety and reusability in code. Generics enable you to write classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters, so you can define and use them with different data types without losing compile-time type checks. The video covers how to declare and use generics, including generic classes, methods, and bounded types, and discusses the benefits, such as preventing runtime errors and enhancing code clarity. Examples demonstrate how generics work with collections like ArrayList and HashMap.</p>

                <p> we discuss the Comparable interface in Java, which is used to define the natural ordering of objects. The Comparable interface requires the implementation of the compareTo() method, which compares the current object with another object of the same type. We explain how this interface is used for sorting collections like lists and arrays. The video also covers real-world examples, demonstrating how to implement the compareTo() method for custom objects and the benefits of using Comparable for efficient sorting.</p>
