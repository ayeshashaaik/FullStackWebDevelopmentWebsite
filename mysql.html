                <p><strong>Introduction to SQL </strong>
                we introduce SQL (Structured Query Language), the standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. We explain its core purpose in interacting with databases to store, retrieve, update, and delete data. The video covers basic SQL concepts such as databases, tables, rows, and columns, and provides an overview of common SQL operations, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Additionally, we discuss the importance of SQL in web development, data analysis, and business intelligence, highlighting its role in managing structured data efficiently.</p>

                    This video covers comparison operators (=, !=, >, etc.), control flow statements (IF, CASE, COALESCE), and window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), etc.) in SQL. Comparison operators help compare values, control flow statements enable conditional logic, and window functions allow advanced data analysis by performing calculations over a set of rows.

                     we discuss aggregate functions in SQL, such as COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX(), which allow you to perform calculations on data. We also cover the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, which are used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query and to skip a specific number of rows, respectively.

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns, often used with aggregate functions to summarize data. The HAVING clause allows you to filter groups based on aggregate function results, providing more control over grouped data.

                    we discuss subqueries in SQL, which are queries embedded within another query. We explain how subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, allowing for more complex and flexible data retrieval. The video highlights the two types of subqueries: scalar (returns a single value) and table (returns a table of results). Through examples, we demonstrate how to use subqueries to filter data, perform calculations, and manage multiple queries in a single statement.</p>

                <p><strong>Joins in SQL</strong>
                    
                     we explain the concept of joins in SQL, which allow you to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column. We cover the different types of joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, explaining how each works and when to use them. The video provides examples of each join type, showing how they help retrieve related data from multiple tables efficiently. Additionally, we discuss the importance of understanding joins for complex database queries and data relationships.</p>

                     we cover SQL joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL) used to combine data from multiple tables. We also explain SQL indexes, which enhance query performance by providing faster data retrieval. The video demonstrates the use of joins and indexes, highlighting their benefits and potential trade-offs, such as increased maintenance overhead during data updates.</p>

                     we cover Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers in SQL. Views are virtual tables simplifying complex queries, Stored Procedures are reusable SQL queries that improve performance, and Triggers automatically execute in response to certain database events. We explain how to create and use these features to enhance database management and automation.</p>

                <p><Strong>Triggers and Normalization in SQL</Strong>

                   we explore Triggers and the concept of Normalization in SQL. Triggers are automatic actions that occur in response to specific events on a database table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. We also discuss Normalization, a process used to organize database tables to reduce redundancy and dependency, ensuring data integrity. The video demonstrates how to implement triggers and apply different normalization forms to optimize database structure.</p>
